            <p class="bio">Hello there!  I've been bounced around the country for a number of years spending most of my time
                as a stay at home dad until a few months ago!  I have two degrees (computational math and physics),
                 was a teacher for a few years, and have been trying to keep my sanity ever since!  Some of the ways
                  I've kept busy have been participating in triathlons, rock climbing, and disc golf.  Out of all the 
                  holidays out there, I have to say that Halloween is absolutely #1.
